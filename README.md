# Client-API
This project is a second-year assignment that extends off of another project, "RPDR-API" . This is the client webpage that uses an API I created based off an American reality television show called "RuPauls Drag Race".  One of the main focuses was incorporating CRUD and allowing users to modify real data from the API's database. The time taken to complete this project was 2 week or roughly 30-40 hours.

# How to run this project
It is very important to do the first step. It will create a "node-modules" directory that supports a chunk of this projects functionality.
1. Run `npm i` command
2. Install "RPDR-API", which can be found on this account and has its own README.md explaining the steps to run it
3. In `package.json` run the scripts ` "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",` and `"build": "vue-cli-service build"`

  - Tokens

# How to use
Once you have done the ` How to run this project` section, You will need to create an account for the client web page. You will be assigned an access level of "basic". In the API's database there is an admin account created through Postman that can also be used. Depending on your accounts access level you can:
-   Vote/Like (basic access)
-   Create a new Queen/Runway (admin access)
-   Update a Queen/Runway's attributes (admin access)
-   Update your account info (basic access)
-   Delete a Queen/Runway (admin access)
-   Delete your account (basic access)
