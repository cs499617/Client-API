# Client-API
This project is a second-year assignment that extends off of another project, "RPDR-API" . This is the client webpage that uses an API I created based off an American reality television show called "RuPauls Drag Race".  One of the main focuses was incorporating CRUD and allowing users to modify real data from the API's database.
